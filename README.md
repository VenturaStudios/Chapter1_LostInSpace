### Todo list For Beta

- Create a "worlds" or "planets" list, to choose levels.
- Polish backgrounds and sprites
- Add all the entities into quadtrees
- Create intro scene

### New game mechanics notes

####level 1: space junkyard

various elements in the enviroment, broken satellites, rocket pieces, etc...

-enemy 1: space rat (invader)

mean looking little rat in a purple spacesuit armed with a rusty gun, shoots single bullets, medium health, fast movement, no formation

-enemy 2: faulty defense drone

scattered, still defensive satellites will shoot lasers and missiles at anybody that comes close, either you or the invaders, powerful firepower, very slow fire rate

-enemy 3: orbital worm 

very large monster, very fast movement, no fire, impossible to kill health, ignores you (the main objective might be to just dodge this one)

-enemy 4: space rat battle station (invader)

flying reverse E shaped contraption manned by 3 space rats, one in each stick of the letter E, stronger firepower than the lone space rat but much slower movement,
they may appear in groups of 3 in line across the vertical, firing out of sync so the player can evade being hit

-final monster: junk mutant

made with pens, washing machines, tvs, pig carcasses, and other junk floating in space, a monster is born, somehow

throws balls of scrap metal and clich√© souvenirs, very large health, slow movement, slow fire rate, big size


level 4: slime nebula

enemy 1: Lamprey guards (invader)
lamprey king
Shoots clouds of poisonous slime that will damage the player as long as he is in contact with it.

export PATH=${PATH}:/home/rafa/tools/adt/sdk/platform-tools
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/rafa/tools/adt/sdk/tools
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/bin/ant
