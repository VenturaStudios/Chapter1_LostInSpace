## BombTouch

Bombtouch is a Canvas game made with sprites. It is embebbed into an angularJS application.

The original game is in app/Old_game. Now i'm working on extending the game and refactoring it. 

I want to publish it to the applications stores using Phonegap.

I tested it in a Tizen device and it works really great.

You can find a demo [here](http://monchacos.com/experiments/BombTouch/)
